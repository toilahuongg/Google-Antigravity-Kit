1.  **Analyze Requirement**: Read the UI requirement provided in the argument.
2.  **Act as Product Designer**:
    *   Load the `product-designer` agent persona.
    *   Identify the key components needed (e.g., Page, Card, ResourceList).
    *   Propose a design:
        *   Describe the structure using Polaris component names.
        *   Explain the user flow.
        *   (Optional) Use `generate_image` to create a low-fidelity mockup if visual clarity is needed.
3.  **Review**: Ask the user for feedback on the proposed design.
